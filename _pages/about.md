As a Research Engineer in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I apply my diverse educational and professional background to conduct research in machine learning interpretability, explainability, and uncertainty quantification. I have over 12 years of experience in scientific and high-performance computing research and its applications, spanning domains such as aerospace engineering, subsea installation engineering, and natural language processing (NLP).

Additionally, I hold the position of Director of Products at GhanaNLP-an impactful open-source initiative that develops NLP tools for low-resourced languages, especially African. Our mission is to advance technology and bridge language gaps in regions such as Ghana and other African countries. We achieve this through innovation in machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and text-to-speech systems.
